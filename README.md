# gamepad_turret
Rep dedicated for my 4fun project including xbox 360`s gamepad controlled mini turret that heats up its tungsten arrows with oxy/mapp torch
# Arduino&Pyhton scripts
This turret uses generic arduino nano to control servos, and xbox 360 gamepad and its HUD. You can find scripts for this abomination in files of this repo.
# IMPORTANT NOTES
1) Dont forget to set correct COM port in python script
2) The only material possible for the darts is tungsten as flame temperature is hot enough to melt everything else.
3) The torch i was using is random generic jewelery oxypropane torch from aliexpress
4) Python itself as well as pigame are required for this to work
